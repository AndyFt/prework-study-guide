# Prework Study Guide Webpage - The first of many

## Description

This guide was created to start a new life project, the beginning of a new era. This project was built to give the first step on the Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development. It contains the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript so that I can have a base to build a broader knowledge.
